          Welcome to my home web page. Iâ€™m currently finishing up the full stack web development boot camp at University
          of Denver. I grew up in California and Oregon, went to school in Idaho, and later moved to Las Vegas for 5
          years. In Idaho, I went to school at Brigham Young University- Idaho, where I met my wife, and graduated with
          a B.A. in Spanish Education with a minor in TESOL. I worked in the school system in various positions for 5
          years, doing everything from teaching and running after school clubs, to managing the campus wide lunch
          program, and training a new maintenance hire. My daughter was born soon after, and we all moved to Colorado
          where I am now.

          I am always happy to learn something new, and enjoy working on something creative. In my spare time, I play
          guitar, read books, watch cartoons, and spend time with my family. I like strategy board games, and especially
          enjoy go, and richii mah-jongg. I feel like web development, and programming are the perfect combination of
          art and logic. I have been playing with code since I was a kid, making little files in apple-script. I am
          learning web development in class, but am also interested in python, swift, computer learning, and making text
          based RPG games. I build websites using  Please feel free to explore the site.
